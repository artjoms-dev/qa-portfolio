# QA Engineer Demo Portfolio – SPH Engineering Application

This Repo is a small portfolio created by **Artjoms Zelenkevičs** [(CV)](CV_Artjoms_Zelenkevics_EN.pdf) for **QA Engineer** position at **SPH Engineering**.

### Repo consist of:
  - [Demo Test Plan](TestPlan/test_plan_demo.pdf) with 2 different manual tests (for GPR Software and Hardware);
  - [Demo Test Cases](TestCase/test-case-demo.pdf) according to Demo Test Plan;
  - [Demo Bug Report](JiraBugReport/Jira_bug_report_demo.JPG) with Jira template usage showcase (example bug from AcademyBugs.com);
  - [Automated Test Example](AutomatedTestExample/GPR_connection_close.py) on Python (complements Demo Test Plan) created with help of [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/).

I hope it will be useful and will show my attitude for both the **crossroad of geophysics and information technologies**, and my will **to become a part of SPH Engineering**.

### Thank you!
